## 1.0 Introduction

**Telangana**
- Telangana is one of the states in India, situated in the south-central part of the Indian subcontinent on the high Deccan Plateau.
- The capital city of Telangana State is Hyderabad.
- Telangana state is divided into 33 districts which are further divided into 584 mandals.
